This is the third time this month! Someone is going to have to bring it up at the next meeting. If he's not careful some thief will break in and steal it, then he'll really be in trouble.

I heard he lives somewhere on South street. I'm thinking maybe one of us should go down there and teach him a lesson. Hopefully he'll remember his key after that!
